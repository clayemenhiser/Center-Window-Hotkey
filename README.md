# Center Window (AutoHotkey v2)

A tiny AutoHotkey v2 script that centers the currently-active window on your monitor with a hotkey.  
The default hotkey is **Ctrl + Shift + C**, but you can change it to whatever you'd like (within the syntax rules of AutoHotkey).

## Why?
My brain doesn't like windows being off center. Also, I had an application launch the window off the screen due to an issue with a monitor being connected/disconnected. This script allowed me to move it back to the center of the screen with a simple hotkey. And who doesn't love their windows being centered?

## Features
- Centers the active window on its current monitor  
- Lightweight
- Customizable hotkey  

## Setup and Usage
1. Install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/).  
2. Run the script. Simply double-click the .ahk file.
3. Press **Ctrl + Shift + C** to center the active window.

## Customization
Edit the hotkey line in the script if you prefer a different shortcut.
